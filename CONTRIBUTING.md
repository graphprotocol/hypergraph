# Contributing

## Setup

```sh
pnpm install
cd apps/server
cp .env.example .env
# add the PRIVY_APP_SECRET & PRIVY_APP_ID to the apps/server/.env file
pnpm prisma migrate dev
```

## Development

```sh
pnpm build --watch
# in another tab
cd apps/events
pnpm dev
# in another tab
cd apps/server
pnpm dev
```

Any time you make changes to the schema, you will need to run the following commands:

```sh
cd apps/server
pnpm prisma migrate dev # this will also generate the Prisma client
```

To develop the create-hypergraph, run:

```sh
cd packages/create-hypergraph
pnpm run dev
```

You can run the Next example app with:

```sh
# Notes:
# - You need to build the packages first and every time you make changes to the packages
cd apps/next-example
pnpm dev
```

To run the docs locally, you can run:

```sh
cd docs
pnpm start
```

## Changesets

Changesets are used to create a changelog and publish a new version of the package. In order to document your changes, you can run the following command:

```sh
pnpm changeset
```

It will open a prompt to ask you which packages are affected and the type of change you are making.


## Upgrading Dependencies

```sh
pnpm up --interactive --latest -r
```

## Publishing

Update the version in the `package.json` files (hypergraph, hypergraph-react)

```sh
pnpm changeset version
pnpm build
pnpm changeset publish
```

## Build and run the Docker image locally

```sh
docker build . -t hypergraph
docker run -it --rm --name=hypergraph hypergraph:latest
```


## Deploying your own SyncServer to Railway

Setup a service and attach a volume under `/data` to it.

Since cache-mounts on Railway need to prefixed with the service ID and BuildKit doesnâ€™t expand variables there. You must give it a literal value for the mount ID.

To do so you can fill in the service ID below and run the command before your `railway up` command.
More info here: https://docs.railway.com/guides/dockerfiles#cache-mounts
Get the service ID by using CMD/CTRL+K and search for `Copy Service ID`.

```sh
sed -i '' \
  's|\(--mount=type=cache,id=\)workspace|\1s/<service-id>-pnpm-store|' \
  Dockerfile
railway up
```

Note: By default horizontal scaling is disabled because of the attached volume.

In the UI setup the following variables for the service:
- set the `DATABASE_URL` to `file:/data/production.sqlite`
- set the `PRIVY_APP_SECRET` to your Privy app secret
- set the `PRIVY_APP_ID` to your Privy app id
- set the `HYPERGRAPH_CHAIN` to your Hypergraph chain

Then restart the service in the UI.

## Deploying your own SyncServer to Fly.io (single instance)

```sh
# change the name of the `app` and `primary_region` in the fly.toml file

# create a volume for the sqlite db file - replace `fra` with your region
fly volumes create data -s 1 -r fra

# set the DATABASE_URL (not sure if it's necessary since already set in the Dockerfile)
fly secrets set DATABASE_URL=file:/data/production.sqlite
# set the Privy app secret, id and chain (fill in your values)
fly secrets set PRIVY_APP_SECRET=<PRIVY_APP_SECRET>
fly secrets set PRIVY_APP_ID=<PRIVY_APP_ID>
fly secrets set HYPERGRAPH_CHAIN=<HYPERGRAPH_CHAIN>

# deploy (ha=false to avoid starting multiple instances)
fly launch --ha=false

# probably not necessary, but better safe than sorry
fly scale count 1
```

### Multi-region deployments

As an alternative you might want to setup a lite-fs volume for multi-region deployments.
