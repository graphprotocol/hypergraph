After months of development and countless conversations with developers like you, **we're thrilled to unveil the Developer Preview version of Hypergraph**. This is more than just another data layer—it's a fundamental rethinking of how we build collaborative, secure, and offline-first Web3 applications.

## Why We Built Hypergraph

The challenges of modern app development are clear: users expect real-time collaboration, bulletproof security, and apps that work flawlessly even when offline. Traditional architectures force uncomfortable trade-offs between these needs. We knew there had to be a better way.

Enter Hypergraph, built on two core innovations: a architecture that puts your data where it belongs—on the client—and our implementation of the GRC-20 standard for truly composable knowledge graphs.

## What Makes Hypergraph Different

<!-- At its heart, Hypergraph will local-first. Every piece of data is stored on the client, making reads and writes instant—no waiting for server responses. When you're online, our CRDT-based sync ensures your data flows seamlessly between devices and collaborators. When you're offline? Everything just works. -->

Security isn't an afterthought—it's built into our foundation. With end-to-end encryption, your data is only readable by those you explicitly trust. No intermediaries, no compromises.

The real magic happens with our GRC-20 Knowledge Graph. It's not just a data format; it's a new way of thinking about how information connects and flows through your applications. Every mutation, whether it's adding a note or updating a relationship, becomes part of a larger, interoperable knowledge network.

<!-- ## Looking Ahead

We're launching this alpha today, July 3. Our roadmap to a stable release in Q4 2025 is ambitious but achievable with your help. The beta will bring enhanced stability, an expanded API surface, and comprehensive documentation based on your feedback. -->

<!-- ## Join the Alpha Today

Getting started is simple. Install our SDK:

```bash
# TODO: ADD INSTALLER TO NPM npm install @hypergraph/sdk-alpha
```

Head to our [Quickstart guide](/docs/quickstart) to build your first Hypergraph app, or dive deep into our [API Reference](/docs/api-reference) to explore the possibilities. We support Node.js and modern browsers, with React hooks that make integration a breeze. -->

## A Note on What to Expect

Let's be transparent: this is an developer preview release. You'll see rapid changes as we iterate based on your feedback. Some features are still experimental, and you might encounter sync delays with larger graphs or limited support on mobile browsers. But that's exactly why we need you—every bug report, feature request, and question helps shape Hypergraph's future.
