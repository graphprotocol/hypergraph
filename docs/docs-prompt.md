You are a world-class technical writer and documentation engineer.  
Given the following spec for a new product feature, generate complete Markdown documentation formatted for Docusuarus that follows modern best practices for both human readers and LLM-based consumption:

1. Include YAML front-matter with `title`, `description`, `version`, and `tags`.  
2. Write a clear **Table of Contents** with anchor links.  
3. Use semantic headings (H1, H2, H3) with descriptive, noun-verb titles.  
4. Provide a **Quickstart** section with a fully runnable code snippet.  
5. Break out a **Core Concepts** section explaining the underlying architecture.  
6. Write detailed **API Reference** entries: each endpoint name, URL path, HTTP method, parameters table, request/response examples, and error codes.  
7. Annotate code samples with inline comments explaining non-obvious steps.  
8. Add **Troubleshooting** and **FAQ** sections covering common pitfalls.  
9. Embed JSON-LD metadata for each API endpoint (including `@type`, `name`, and `url`).  
10. Conclude with **Further Reading** links and an **Edit on GitHub** badge.

Output the result as a single Markdown document formatted for Docusaurus (no HTML).
