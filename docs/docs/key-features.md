# üåü Key Features

Hypergraph is **more than a database**‚Äîit's a complete data layer for building collaborative, local-first apps. Below is a tour of the capabilities you get out of the box.

<!-- ## Local-first by design

Data is **persisted first on the client**‚Äînot on a remote database. Users can create, read and mutate data instantly with zero network latency. Changes sync asynchronously when connectivity is available.

* **No loading spinners.** State is always available locally.
* **No data silos.** You own the raw event log. -->

## End-to-end encryption

Every update is encrypted **on the client** using XChaCha20-Poly1305. Only members of a Space possess the symmetric key, so neither the sync server nor The Graph can read private data.

* **Automatic key rotation**: when members join/leave (not yet implemented).
* **Multi-device**: each device holds its own key pair.

## Knowledge Graph SDK

Build, link, and publish knowledge as entities and relations using the [`@graphprotocol/grc-20`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@graphprotocol/grc-20) Knowledge Graph SDK. It makes it easy to organize data into spaces, anchor edits onchain, and work with The Graph's knowledge graph standard.

## Graph-based data model

Under the hood, Hypergraph stores JSON-LD values that map nicely to **knowledge graphs**. This makes it trivial to expose public data on-chain or query it with a GRC-20 compliant indexer later.

## Conflict-free sync (CRDTs)

We use **Automerge** (a JSON CRDT) to merge concurrent edits without conflicts. Snapshots are automatically compacted to keep payloads small.

## Spaces & fine-grained auth

A **Space** groups both *people* and *data*. Fine-grained access will come soon.
<!-- Roles (`admin`, `member`, `viewer`) are enforced on the wire and checked again client-side. -->

<!-- ## Web3-native identities

Authentication is handled by **SIWE (Sign-In With Ethereum)**. Each user signs requests with an Ed25519 key that can be deterministically derived from their wallet. -->

<!-- ## Headless React hooks

The `@graphprotocol/hypergraph-react` package exposes ergonomic hooks:

```ts
const { space, updates, send } = useHypergraph(spaceId);
```

They work in **React Server Components** and React Native alike. -->

<!-- ## Offline support & optimistic UI

Because writes land locally first, you can render results immediately. Hypergraph retries sync in the background with exponential back-off. -->

<!-- ## Tiny sync server

All the server does is **relay encrypted events** and store blobs. It's stateless, horizontally scalable and can be deployed on a hobby tier instance. -->

<!-- ## Open standards

* **JSON-LD** for semantics
* **IPFS** for public blobs
* **DID / SIWE** for identity -->
