# üß† Core Concepts

Hypergraph re-imagines traditional client‚Äìserver apps as **local-first**, **peer-syncing** knowledge graphs. Understanding the following building blocks will help you design applications that feel real-time, privacy-preserving, and interoperable by default.

## Spaces

A **Space** is the fundamental unit of collaboration.

* Think of it as a **folder**, **Slack channel**, or **Google Doc**‚Äîit groups both *people* and *data*.
* Each Space maps 1-to-1 with an **Automerge** document for conflict-free offline editing.
* Membership & roles (`member`, `editor`, `admin`) are tracked by an append-only _Space Event Log_.

### Lifecycle events

| Event | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `createSpace` | Bootstrap a new Space and establish its first encryption key. |
| `deleteSpace` | Mark the Space as deleted (soft delete). |
| `updateMember` | Promote or demote a member role. |
| `removeMember` | Kick a member and rotate keys. |
| `createInvite` / `acceptInvite` | Securely invite users‚Äîkeys are boxed to the invitee's public key. |

All events are **signed** by the author and **verified** by the sync server before broadcast.

## Identities

Every user controls an **Identity** defined by three asymmetric keypairs:

1. **Signature keys** ‚Äî Ed25519 keys used to sign Space Events.
2. **Encryption keys** ‚Äî X25519 keys used to encrypt private Space data.
3. **Account keys** ‚Äî An EVM account (via wallet) used for SIWE authentication.

Identities are encrypted with a **session token** and stored in the browser (`localStorage`, IndexedDB, or the filesystem in React Native). This keeps the SDK _stateless_‚Äîyou can log in on multiple devices without a backend.

## Inboxes

An **Inbox** is a lightweight message queue that delivers updates or DMs.

* **Account Inboxes** belong to a single user.
* **Space Inboxes** broadcast to all members of a Space.

Inboxes can be **public** (anyone can read) or **private** (E2EE). Auth policies decide who may send:

```ts
type InboxSenderAuthPolicy = 'any' | 'members' | 'admins';
```

## Knowledge Graph

Public data isn't shoved into a siloed SQL DB. Instead, Hypergraph publishes JSON-LD to a decentralized Knowledge Graph (IPFS + Polygon Amoy smart contracts).

Benefits:

* **Composability** ‚Äî one app's `City` objects can be queried by another app.
* **Network effects** ‚Äî each new Space or entity enriches the shared graph.

A TypeScript codegen tool (see the _TypeSync app_ in `/apps/typesync`) maps your domain models to on-chain schemas so you can query them like regular React hooks.

## Events & CRDTs

1. A client mutates the Automerge document (`doc.put(‚Ä¶‚Äã)`).
2. The SDK encodes the change as **CRDT updates**.
3. Updates are encrypted with the current **spaceKey** and batched into a `sendUpdate` event.
4. The sync server verifies, persists, and broadcasts updates to online peers.
5. Peers apply the updates; conflicts resolve automatically.

When the event log grows large, a peer may emit `sendCompactedUpdate`‚Äîa snapshot that starts a fresh log segment.

## Security Model

| Threat | Mitigation |
|--------|-----------|
| Server reads private data | **E2EE** ‚Äî all document updates are encrypted client-side with a per-Space symmetric key. |
| Forged events | **Signature verification** for every event using the author's public key. |
| Stale clients | Each event carries `lastKnownSpaceEventId`; server rejects out-of-date mutations. |
| Key leakage on member removal | **Key rotation** through `removeMember` ‚Üí generates a new `spaceKey`. |
