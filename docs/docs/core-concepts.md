# 🧠 Core Concepts

Hypergraph re-imagines traditional client–server apps as **local-first**, **peer-syncing** knowledge graphs. Understanding the following building blocks will help you design applications that feel real-time, privacy-preserving, and interoperable by default.

## Knowledge Graphs and GRC-20

Hypergraph adopts **GRC-20** as its canonical data format. Every mutation you perform through the Hypergraph SDK—whether it's adding a note, uploading a photo, or inviting a collaborator—ultimately becomes a set of GRC-20 triples bundled into an edit. Each **[Space](#spaces)** you create is simply a scoped knowledge graph that can reference and be referenced by any other space, giving your app instant access to a global pool of interoperable data.

### 1. The GRC-20 Standard
The GRC-20 standard defines how knowledge is structured, shared, and connected in a decentralized, composable way—enabling interoperability across web3 applications. It specifies the core building blocks: entities, types, properties, relations, and triples. Read the [GRC-20 spec on GitHub](https://github.com/graphprotocol/graph-improvement-proposals/blob/main/grcs/0020-knowledge-graph.md).

### 2. Core Data Model Concepts

To illustrate the core pieces of a knowledge graph, we'll break down a single sentence:

> **"Teresa, a photographer, owns a Fujifilm camera."**

#### The Triple Model (EAV)
At the heart of GRC-20 is the **triple**: every fact is stored as a tuple of **Entity**, **Attribute** (property or relation), and **Value** (EAV).

**Example triple in JSON:**
```json
{
  "entity": "Teresa_ID",
  "attribute": "profession",
  "value": {
    "type": 1, // Text
    "value": "photographer"
  }
}
```

**Example triple in code:**
```ts
Graph.createEntity({
  name: 'Teresa',
  types: [PERSON_TYPE_ID],
  values: [
    { property: PROFESSION_ATTR_ID, value: 'photographer' }
  ]
});
```

#### IDs: Where Do They Come From?
Every entity, attribute, and relation has a unique ID (usually a string, e.g. `PERSON_TYPE_ID`). These are generated per your schema or space, and are required for all operations.

#### Entities & Types
**Entity:** A unique thing in the graph (e.g., `Teresa`, `Camera`).
**Type:** A category for entities (e.g., `Person`, `Device`).

```ts
const PERSON_TYPE_ID = 'PERSON_TYPE_ID';
const DEVICE_TYPE_ID = 'DEVICE_TYPE_ID';
const PROFESSION_ATTR_ID = 'PROFESSION_ATTR_ID';
const BRAND_ATTR_ID = 'BRAND_ATTR_ID';

const { id: cameraId, ops: cameraOps } = Graph.createEntity({
  name: 'Camera',
  types: [DEVICE_TYPE_ID],
  values: [
    { property: BRAND_ATTR_ID, value: 'Fujifilm' },
  ],
});

const { id: teresaId, ops: teresaOps } = Graph.createEntity({
  name: 'Teresa',
  types: [PERSON_TYPE_ID],
  values: [
    { property: PROFESSION_ATTR_ID, value: 'photographer' },
  ],
});
```

#### Properties vs. Relations
- **Property:** Attaches data to a single entity (e.g., `Camera` → `brand` → `Fujifilm`).
- **Relation:** Connects two entities (e.g., `Teresa` → `owns` → `Camera`). Relations are themselves entities and can have their own properties (e.g., `date_acquired`).

```ts
const OWNS_REL_TYPE_ID = 'OWNS_REL_TYPE_ID';
const DATE_ACQUIRED_ATTR_ID = 'DATE_ACQUIRED_ATTR_ID';

import { getEntityRelations } from '@graphprotocol/grc-20';

// 1️⃣ Fetch existing owns relations for Teresa
const existingOwns = getEntityRelations(teresaId, PersonSchema, doc).owns;

// 2️⃣ Only create if none exists pointing to this camera
if (!existingOwns.find(rel => rel.id === cameraId)) {
  const { ops: ownsOps } = Graph.createRelation({
    fromEntity: teresaId,
    toEntity: cameraId,
    relationType: OWNS_REL_TYPE_ID,
    values: [
      { property: DATE_ACQUIRED_ATTR_ID, value: Graph.serializeDate(new Date('2020-03-15')) },
    ],
  });
  // add ownsOps to your edit batch…
}
```

**Relation as triple in JSON:**
```json
{
  "entity": "OwnsRelation_ID",
  "attribute": "date_acquired",
  "value": {
    "type": 5, // Time
    "value": "2020-03-15T00:00:00.000Z"
  }
}
```

#### Searching and Idempotency
The SDK generates a new ID for every entity or relation you create—even if an identical relation already exists. To avoid duplicates:

- **Query existing relations** via your GraphQL endpoint with a filter on `from`, `relationType`, and `to`.
- **Use** `getEntityRelations` (from `@graphprotocol/grc-20`) on a local handle to list current relations for an entity:

```ts
import { getEntityRelations } from '@graphprotocol/grc-20';

// Returns all non-deleted owns relations from Teresa
const relations = getEntityRelations(teresaId, PersonSchema, doc).owns;
```

- **Check** if a relation linking the same entities already exists before calling `Graph.createRelation`.

If you call `createRelation` without checking, you'll end up with multiple relation entities of the same type between the same entities. Deduplication is the responsibility of your application or schema governance.

#### Minimal Edit Example
Bundle all operations into an edit:
```ts
const ops = [...cameraOps, ...teresaOps, ...ownsOps];
// Publish ops as an edit (see SDK docs for publishing)
```

Let's bring together everything we've learned above—including our example sentence—into a complete GRC-20–compliant TypeScript example that is fully composable with Hypergraph.

```ts title="example.ts"
// Example: "Teresa, a photographer, owns a Fujifilm camera."
// 1. Create a Camera entity with a brand property
// 2. Create a Teresa entity with a profession property
// 3. Create an 'owns' relation entity linking Teresa to the Camera
// 4. Bundle all operations into a single edit (ops array)

import { Graph } from '@graphprotocol/grc-20';
import { getEntityRelations } from '@graphprotocol/grc-20';

// Replace these with actual IDs from your schema/space
const PERSON_TYPE_ID = 'PERSON_TYPE_ID';
const DEVICE_TYPE_ID = 'DEVICE_TYPE_ID';
const PROFESSION_ATTR_ID = 'PROFESSION_ATTR_ID';
const BRAND_ATTR_ID = 'BRAND_ATTR_ID';
const OWNS_REL_TYPE_ID = 'OWNS_REL_TYPE_ID';
const DATE_ACQUIRED_ATTR_ID = 'DATE_ACQUIRED_ATTR_ID';

// 1️⃣ Create the Camera entity with a brand property
const { id: cameraId, ops: cameraOps } = Graph.createEntity({
  name: 'Fujifilm camera',      // Human-readable label
  types: [DEVICE_TYPE_ID],        // Device type
  values: [
    { property: BRAND_ATTR_ID, value: 'Fujifilm' },  // brand property
  ],
});

// 2️⃣ Create the Teresa entity with a profession property
const { id: teresaId, ops: teresaOps } = Graph.createEntity({
  name: 'Teresa',                 // Human-readable label
  types: [PERSON_TYPE_ID],        // Person type
  values: [
    { property: PROFESSION_ATTR_ID, value: 'photographer' }, // profession property
  ],
});

// 1️⃣ Fetch existing owns relations for Teresa
const existingOwns = getEntityRelations(teresaId, PersonSchema, doc).owns;

// 2️⃣ Only create if none exists pointing to this camera
if (!existingOwns.find(rel => rel.id === cameraId)) {
  const { ops: ownsOps } = Graph.createRelation({
    fromEntity: teresaId,
    toEntity: cameraId,
    relationType: OWNS_REL_TYPE_ID,
    values: [
      { property: DATE_ACQUIRED_ATTR_ID, value: Graph.serializeDate(new Date('2020-03-15')) },
    ],
  });
  // add ownsOps to your edit batch…
}

// 4️⃣ Combine all ops into a single edit
const ops = [...cameraOps, ...teresaOps, ...ownsOps];
console.log('Ops ready for publishing:', ops);

// (Optional) Publish the edit
// Graph.publishEdit({ ops });
```

#### Mental Model Recap
- **Entities** are things.
- **Properties** are facts about things.
- **Relations** connect things (and can have their own properties).
- **Triples** are atomic facts (entity, attribute, value).
- **Edits** are batches of changes.

#### Cheat Sheet Table
| Concept  | Example in Sentence | GRC-20 Term | Code Snippet |
|----------|---------------------|-------------|--------------|
| Entity   | Teresa, Camera      | Entity      | `{ id, name }` |
| Type     | Person, Device      | Type        | `types: [PERSON_TYPE_ID]` |
| Property | profession, brand   | Attribute   | `{ property: BRAND_ATTR_ID, value: 'Fujifilm' }` |
| Relation | owns                | Relation Entity | `createRelation()` |
| Edit     | batch of all triples | Edit        | `ops: [...]` |

_All of the above is not just theory—Hypergraph puts it to work for you._ **When you call the SDK or its React hooks, Hypergraph turns your mutations into triples, bundles them into edits, encrypts them (if the Space is private), and syncs them peer-to-peer or anchors them on-chain if the data is public.** As a developer you think in entities and hooks; behind the scenes Hypergraph speaks pure GRC-20.

---

All of these building blocks are specified by the GRC-20 standard and created in code with the GRC-20 SDK.

### 3. The GRC-20 SDK
The [`@graphprotocol/grc-20`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@graphprotocol/grc-20) SDK is a toolkit for building, reading, and writing GRC-20-compliant knowledge graphs. It provides APIs for creating entities, types, properties, and relations, and handles serialization, publishing to IPFS, and onchain anchoring—making it easy to implement the GRC-20 standard in your apps.

## Spaces

A **Space** is the fundamental unit of collaboration.

* Think of it as a **folder**, **Slack channel**, or **Google Doc**—it groups both *people* and *data*.
* Each Space maps 1-to-1 with an **Automerge** document for conflict-free offline editing.
* Membership & roles (`member`, `editor`, `admin`) are tracked by an append-only _Space Event Log_.

### Lifecycle events

| Event | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `createSpace` | Bootstrap a new Space and establish its first encryption key. |
| `deleteSpace` | Mark the Space as deleted (soft delete). |
| `updateMember` | Promote or demote a member role. |
| `removeMember` | Kick a member and rotate keys. |
| `createInvite` / `acceptInvite` | Securely invite users—keys are boxed to the invitee's public key. |

All events are **signed** by the author and **verified** by the sync server before broadcast.

## Identities

Every user controls an **Identity** defined by three asymmetric keypairs:

1. **Signature keys** — Ed25519 keys used to sign Space Events.
2. **Encryption keys** — X25519 keys used to encrypt private Space data.
3. **Account keys** — An EVM account (via wallet) used for SIWE authentication.

Identities are encrypted with a **session token** and stored in the browser (`localStorage`, IndexedDB, or the filesystem in React Native). This keeps the SDK _stateless_—you can log in on multiple devices without a backend.

## Inboxes

An **Inbox** is a lightweight message queue that delivers updates or DMs.

* **Account Inboxes** belong to a single user.
* **Space Inboxes** broadcast to all members of a Space.

Inboxes can be **public** (anyone can read) or **private** (E2EE). Auth policies decide who may send:

```ts
type InboxSenderAuthPolicy = 'any' | 'members' | 'admins';
```

## Events & CRDTs

1. A client mutates the Automerge document (`doc.put(…​)`).
2. The SDK encodes the change as **CRDT updates**.
3. Updates are encrypted with the current **spaceKey** and batched into a `sendUpdate` event.
4. The sync server verifies, persists, and broadcasts updates to online peers.
5. Peers apply the updates; conflicts resolve automatically.

When the event log grows large, a peer may emit `sendCompactedUpdate`—a snapshot that starts a fresh log segment.

## Security Model

| Threat | Mitigation |
|--------|-----------|
| Server reads private data | **E2EE** — all document updates are encrypted client-side with a per-Space symmetric key. |
| Forged events | **Signature verification** for every event using the author's public key. |
| Stale clients | Each event carries `lastKnownSpaceEventId`; server rejects out-of-date mutations. |
| Key leakage on member removal | **Key rotation** through `removeMember` → generates a new `spaceKey`. |

:::tip Best Practice
**Always check for an existing relation (by `from`, `to`, and `relationType`) before creating a new one.**

This prevents duplicate relations, keeps your data model clean, and avoids ambiguity in queries and UI. The GRC-20 SDK will create a new relation entity every time unless you check first.
