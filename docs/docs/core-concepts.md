# üß† Core Concepts

Hypergraph re-imagines traditional client‚Äìserver apps as knowledge graphs. Understanding the following building blocks will help you design applications that feel real-time, privacy-preserving, and interoperable by default.

## Knowledge Graphs

Traditional databases store data in rows and columns. Knowledge graphs store data as **networks of connected information**‚Äîthink of it like a mind map where every piece of information can link to any other piece.

### Why Knowledge Graphs?

Imagine you're building a social app. In a traditional database, you might have separate tables for `users`, `posts`, and `likes`. But what if you want to find "posts by photographers that my friends liked"? That requires complex joins across multiple tables.

In a knowledge graph, the relationships *are* the data:

```mermaid
graph LR
  Teresa[üë© Teresa] -->|profession| Photography[üì∏ Photography]
  Teresa -->|owns| Camera[üì∑ Fujifilm X100]
  Teresa -->|posted| Photo[üñºÔ∏è Street Photo]
  Alex[üë® Alex] -->|friend_of| Teresa
  Alex -->|liked| Photo
```

This makes complex queries natural and fast. Plus, your data model can evolve organically‚Äîjust add new types of entities and relationships without schema migrations.

### The Hypergraph Advantage

Hypergraph takes knowledge graphs further by making them:

- **üîí Private by default** ‚Äî Your personal data stays encrypted on your device
- **üåê Peer-to-peer** ‚Äî No central server required; collaborate directly with friends
- **‚ö° Real-time** ‚Äî Changes sync instantly across all your devices
- **üîó Interoperable** ‚Äî Your data works across different apps that speak the same protocol

> **The magic:** Under the hood, Hypergraph serializes everything using the **GRC-20** standard. As a developer, you just work with simple SDK calls‚ÄîHypergraph handles the complex cryptography, serialization, and networking. If you're curious about the low-level details, check out the [GRC-20 section](#grc-20-advanced) below.

## Spaces

A **Space** is the fundamental unit of collaboration.

* Think of it as a **folder**, **Slack channel**, or **Google Doc**‚Äîit groups both *people* and *data*.
* Each Space maps 1-to-1 with an **Automerge** document for conflict-free offline editing.
* Membership & roles (`member`, `editor`, `admin`) are tracked by an append-only _Space Event Log_.

### Lifecycle events

| Event | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `createSpace` | Bootstrap a new Space and establish its first encryption key. |
| `deleteSpace` | Mark the Space as deleted (soft delete). |
| `updateMember` | Promote or demote a member role. |
| `removeMember` | Kick a member and rotate keys. |
| `createInvite` / `acceptInvite` | Securely invite users‚Äîkeys are boxed to the invitee's public key. |

All events are **signed** by the author and **verified** by the sync server before broadcast.

## Identities

Every user controls an **Identity** defined by three asymmetric keypairs:

1. **Signature keys** ‚Äî Ed25519 keys used to sign Space Events.
2. **Encryption keys** ‚Äî X25519 keys used to encrypt private Space data.
3. **Account keys** ‚Äî An EVM account (via wallet) used for SIWE authentication.

Identities are encrypted with a **session token** and stored in the browser (`localStorage`, IndexedDB, or the filesystem in React Native). This keeps the SDK _stateless_‚Äîyou can log in on multiple devices without a backend.

## Inboxes

An **Inbox** is a lightweight message queue that delivers updates or DMs.

* **Account Inboxes** belong to a single user.
* **Space Inboxes** broadcast to all members of a Space.

Inboxes can be **public** (anyone can read) or **private** (E2EE). Auth policies decide who may send:

```ts
type InboxSenderAuthPolicy = 'any' | 'members' | 'admins';
```

## Events & CRDTs

1. A client mutates the Automerge document (`doc.put(‚Ä¶‚Äã)`).
2. The SDK encodes the change as **CRDT updates**.
3. Updates are encrypted with the current **spaceKey** and batched into a `sendUpdate` event.
4. The sync server verifies, persists, and broadcasts updates to online peers.
5. Peers apply the updates; conflicts resolve automatically.

When the event log grows large, a peer may emit `sendCompactedUpdate`‚Äîa snapshot that starts a fresh log segment.

## Security Model

| Threat | Mitigation |
|--------|-----------|
| Server reads private data | **E2EE** ‚Äî all document updates are encrypted client-side with a per-Space symmetric key. |
| Forged events | **Signature verification** for every event using the author's public key. |
| Stale clients | Each event carries `lastKnownSpaceEventId`; server rejects out-of-date mutations. |
| Key leakage on member removal | **Key rotation** through `removeMember` ‚Üí generates a new `spaceKey`. |

## How Can I Explore a Space's Data?

You can browse a space's data using [Geo Browser's Testnet](https://testnet.geobrowser.io/root). Simply enter the Space ID you want to explore into the search bar to view its contents. If you do not have access to the data due to privacy restrictions, you will not be able to view the data. 

## GRC-20: The Protocol Under the Hood

> **‚ö†Ô∏è Advanced Section:** You don't need to understand GRC-20 to build with Hypergraph! This is for developers who want to understand the underlying protocol or need low-level access to the knowledge graph.

Think of GRC-20 as the "assembly language" of knowledge graphs. While Hypergraph gives you high-level React hooks and intuitive APIs, GRC-20 defines the precise data format that makes everything interoperable.

### Why Does GRC-20 Exist?

Imagine if every social app stored data differently‚ÄîInstagram used JSON, TikTok used XML, Twitter used CSV. Your photos, posts, and connections would be trapped in silos forever.

GRC-20 solves this by creating a **universal format** for knowledge. Any app that speaks GRC-20 can read, write, and build upon data created by any other GRC-20 app.

### Edit on GitHub

[‚úèÔ∏è Suggest changes](https://github.com/graphprotocol/hypergraph/edit/main/docs/docs/core-concepts.md) 

:::tip Best Practice
**Always check for an existing relation (by `from`, `to`, and `relationType`) before creating a new one.**

This prevents duplicate relations, keeps your data model clean, and avoids ambiguity in queries and UI. The GRC-20 SDK will create a new relation entity every time unless you check first.
:::

:::info Terminology Update
In the latest GRC-20 spec, what were previously called "triples" are now called "values." The "value type" is now called "data type," and data types are defined on the property, not the value. This change makes the model simpler and validation more robust.
:::

**Note:** The data service validates that each value matches the property's data type.
