# Publishing Public Data

Once you want to share your data with the world you need to publish it. This is done by creating the necessary `Opertations` (Ops) and then publishing them.

## Prepare Publish (not yet supported)

Based on entity Ids, the source space and the target space this function calculates the necessary `Operations` to publish the data.

```tsx
import { preparePublish } from "@graphprotocol/hypergraph-react";

const { ops, diff } = preparePublish({
  entityIds: ["entity-id-1", "entity-id-2"],
  privateSourceSpace: "private-source-space-id",
  publicTargetSpace: "public-target-space-id",
});
```

## Publishing Relations

```tsx
import { publishOps } from '@graphprotocol/hypergraph-react';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const { getSmartSessionClient } = useHypergraphApp();

  const publishChanges = async () => {
    const smartSessionClient = await getSmartSessionClient();

    const ops = [â€¦];

    const result = await publishOps({
      ops,
      walletClient: smartSessionClient,
      space,
      name: 'Create Job Offers',
    });
  }
}
```
