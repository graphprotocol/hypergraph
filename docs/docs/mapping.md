# Mapping

The public knowledge graph is based on property IDs. In order to integrate with the public knowledge graph you need to map your own schema to IDs from the public graph's schema.

This is done using an object called a mapping. The mapping has to be provided to the `HypergraphAppProvider` component.

A mapping entry defines the type IDs, properties and relations of a type. Here is an example mapping for a schema with an `Event` and a `Company`:

```tsx
export const mapping: Mapping = {
  Event: {
    typeIds: [Id.Id('407d9e8a-c703-4fb4-830d-98c758c8564e')],
    properties: {
      name: Id.Id('a126ca53-0c8e-48d5-b888-82c734c38935'),
    },
    relations: {
      sponsors: Id.Id('a7ac80a6-d3d9-4b04-9b9f-ead1723af09f'),
    },
  },
  Company: {
    typeIds: [Id.Id('b0220a78-9205-4e5e-9bf1-c03ee0791e23')],
    properties: {
      name: Id.Id('a126ca53-0c8e-48d5-b888-82c734c38935'),
    },
  },
```

The entire mapping structure can be generated using the TypeSync tool.

```bash
pnpm install -g @graphprotocol/hypergraph-cli@latest
hg typesync --open
```

## Mapping Examples

You can search for dozens of schema/mapping examples on the [Hypergraph Schema Browser](https://schema-browser.vercel.app/).

## Creating and publishing new Properties and Types

We created a script to create and publish new properties and types to the public knowledge graph. You can find it at [https://github.com/geobrowser/create-types-and-properties](https://github.com/geobrowser/create-types-and-properties).
