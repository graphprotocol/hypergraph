# 🪙 Geo Testnet Faucet

Need some GEO testnet tokens to start building with Hypergraph? Use our public faucet to quickly top-up your wallet.

[**Open the Geo Faucet**](https://faucet.conduit.xyz/geo-test-zc16z3tcvf)

## How it works

1. Switch your wallet/network to **Geo Testnet**.
2. Navigate to the faucet URL above and connect your wallet.
3. Click **Request tokens**. You should receive GEO in a few seconds.

That's it! You can now use the test tokens with any Hypergraph-powered app running on the Geo Testnet.

> Tip: If you run out of test tokens, come back to the faucet and request again (rate-limited to prevent abuse).
