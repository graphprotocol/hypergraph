# 🚀 Quickstart

The quickest way to create a new Hypergraph application you can use the `create-hypergraph` CLI command. Make sure you have Node.js >= 22 installed.

```bash
npx create-hypergraph@latest
# or
pnpm create hypergraph@latest
bunx create-hypergraph@latest
yarn create hypergraph@latest
```

During installation, you'll see the following prompts to choose your app name, template, and package manager.


1. What is your app named? …
2. Choose your template …
3. What package manager do you want to use? …


After the prompts, you'll have a new Hypergraph application ready to use and can start exploring the app. To run it use the following command:

```bash
cd my-hypergraph-app
npm run dev
# or depending on your package manager
yarn run dev
pnpm run dev
bun run dev
```

Open the browser, navigate to `http://localhost:5173` and you should see the app running.
